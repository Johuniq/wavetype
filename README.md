Recording modes

| Mode         | Hotkey                                 | Behavior                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Push-to-talk | configurable (default: `Ctrl+Shift+R`) | Hold to record, release to transcribe         |
| Toggle       | configurable (default: `Ctrl+Shift+T`) | Press to start recording, press again to stop |

## Configuration and data location

Settings and history are stored locally in an SQLite database in the platform's application data directory. Example locations:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%/com.johuniq.WaveType/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.johuniq.WaveType/`

## Security and privacy

- All transcription is performed locally; audio is not uploaded to remote services by default.
- The backend validates and sanitizes IPC inputs to reduce risk from malformed data.
- Strong encryption (AES-256-GCM) for sensitive data storage.
- Open-source code for transparency and security auditing.

## Installation

⚠️ **First-time installation?** See [INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions, including how to handle security warnings on macOS and Windows.

**Quick install:**
1. Download the latest release for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/WaveType/releases)
2. Follow the installation steps in the guide above
3. On first launch, you may need to bypass a security warning (one-time only)

**Why security warnings?** As a solo developer project, we distribute without code signing certificates ($299-599/year) to keep the project sustainable. The code is open-source and auditable - see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for details.
